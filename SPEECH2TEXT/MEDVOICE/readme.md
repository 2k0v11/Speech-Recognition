# MEDVOICE - Integrating Speech Translation in the Medical Field

### This is a prototype model based on the Tkinter framework to present the business idea that was put forward by our team for a Hackathon organized by Visionet, Where we stood 2nd out of 400 teams participating in the event. 
## It is a simple but effective prototype model that uses the 'speech_recognition' library to transcribe the words said by a person and keep a note of it. This principle is applied in healthcare; suppose you visit a hospital and the doctor prescribes some medicines or a few precautions to be followed. It all happens on a piece of paper and this is where the idea comes into the picture, as to allow doctors to use this technology to digitalize this whole interaction process. This effectively saves a lot of paper in the healthcare industry. The details of the work is as mentioned below:

### DEMO:
#### step-1: Hit the Record Prescription button to allow speech detection and transcription
