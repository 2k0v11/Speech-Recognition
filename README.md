# Speech-Recognition

## This repository contains code related to speech recognition tasks. It’s organized into two main folders:

### SPEECH2TEXT:
#### In this folder, you’ll find a minor project that secured 2nd place in the VISIONET hackathon. Additionally, there’s a Python file for speech-to-text translation. Feel free to explore the project and the speech-to-text code!

### TEXT2SPEECH:
#### The TEXT2SPEECH folder contains a Python file for text-to-speech conversion. Use this code to generate speech from text input.
